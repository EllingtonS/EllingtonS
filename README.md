### Hi Everyone 👋

I'm Ellington, I'm a Junior in Aerospace Engineering from Aurora, Colorado. I use he/they pronouns. 

I'm interested in aerodynamics and orbital mechanics, but I'm looking to learn more about programming and integrating programming concepts into my personal interests.

I really enjoy Formula 1 and racing games, as well as photograpy and cinematograpy.
